Vaccines have become a daily discussion, with the COVID-19 pandemic showing us how critical they are to saving lives.

Vaccines consist of a modified bacteria or virus impostor that makes your body fire its defences. If you encounter the actual threat, your immune system remembers it and fights back. Recently, we’ve developed vaccines using genetic information to get your own body to produce the impostor and attack it.

Although we developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in record time, vaccine manufacturing is a complex process. It involves culturing chicken eggs or other cells, such as yeast and human cells, in large bioreactors with careful filtering processes to produce the impostors – an expensive task often limited to wealthy countries. COVID vaccines must also be stored cold, another challenge for global distribution.

Instead of relying on animal cells, we can use plants to produce pathogen impostors – the virus-like particles. Researchers have now used engineered bacteria and plant viruses to insert the genetic info responsible for producing these impostors into leaves of mature plants like tobacco. The leaves take up the genetic information and make loads of impostors that we can harvest and purify.

One such plant-based vaccine for COVID-19 produced by the Medicago company is now in human testing. Other vaccines, like those for influenza, are at earlier stages of development.

Even though we would still have to store the purified impostor at low temperatures (2-8 C), researchers are developing vaccines in the form of powdered leaves (e.g. lettuce) that have already produced virus-like particles! They can be stored at room temperature and easily transported. By using greenhouses instead of fancy bioreactors, plant-based vaccines are an affordable alternative for countries with limited manufacturing resources. Who knew we could use plants to produce life-saving vaccines!
