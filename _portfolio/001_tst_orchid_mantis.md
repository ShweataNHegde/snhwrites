At first glance you might see only a bunch of flowers. But on closer inspection, you can spot a gorgeous white insect disguised as a flower. With its pinkish-white body and petal-like legs, female Orchid Mantises resemble a beautiful blossom. Hymenopus coronatus are mainly found in the forests of Southeast Asia. 

Unlike chameleons, which camouflage to fend off predators, orchid mantises mimic flowers to be a better predator. They sit still and wait for a pollinator to approach. When it's close, they use their front legs to quickly grab the prey and feast on it.

But that's not all there is to it. Researchers have recently discovered that orchid mantises mimic a flower not to blend in, but to stand out. They don't always need to sit on a flower, but can attract pollinators at rates similar to (or sometimes better than) real flowers. From an insect's perspective, mantises look bigger and brighter than the surrounding flowers. This phenomenon, where the mantises tap into the sensory biases of their prey, is known as aggressive mimicry.

Despite what the name implies, mantises don't mimic an orchid. Instead, they just look like a flower. This way, they can attract a wide variety of pollinators which increases their chances of getting prey. Their menu can vary from bees, moths, butterflies to even lizards. Because they are seldom encountered in the wild, little is known about their habitat and potential conservation threats.

Orchid mantises are a brilliant example of perfect evolutionary adaptation. We are only beginning to understand the mysteries of nature. There are many such,incredible species with unimaginable adaptations yet to be discovered.
