It took me a long time to get a website up and running. The problem was that I dabbled with them a bit too much. This time, I'm trying not to think through so much. 

To set up a website, I've spent quite some time looking for free Jekyll themes. I've found lots of useful and some interesting ones. I might want to make a list of those somewhere.
