Hi, I'm Shweata. I've been trying to set up a website for myself for quite some time now. Perfectionalism got the best out of me. I've almost had a website up and running, but each time it felt something was missing. Either the theme didn't have a feature I wanted or I couldn't get something to work. This time, however, I've decided that it's important for me to have something up on the web than to have the perfect one up. 

I don't have a clear idea as to what I'll use the site for. I wanted it to be like a semi-public diary. I need to work out the details. We'll see :)
